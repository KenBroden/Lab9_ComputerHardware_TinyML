*Lab completed by Ken Broden*

## Computer Hardware and Tiny Machine Learning (in progress)

### Motivation

This new lab assignment provides valuable exposure to the areas of computer hardware and tiny machine learning, which previously have received minimal coverage.

### Benefit

Learning this lab assignment can benefit the students when they find internships related to computer hardware (e.g., DigiKey). In the vast expanse of technology and innovation, it is not always the largest systems, but the smallest ones, that can change the world.

### Assignment 1

Please deploy a keyword-spotting tiny machine learning model on the Nano 33 BLE Board. When you say “yes”, the red LED turns on and the Serial Monitor displays “yes”; when you say “no”, the blue LED turns on and the Serial Monitor displays “no”.

Please take pictures of your Nano 33 BLE board that shows red or blue LED, and screenshots of your Serial Monitor that shows “yes” and “no”. Please submit both your pictures, screenshots, and URL of your Github source code on Canvas.
